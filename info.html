        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hello! I'm Amalia and I am a digital artist and graphic designer. I am currently studying Graphic Communication and Design 
        at Quasar Institute in Rome. </p>
        <p> My illustration work is inspired by anything around me that inspires me or provokes thought, including (but definitely not limited to) music, people, stories, and nature. 
            My design work is inspired by what I want to see in the commercial world, designs that speak to people and have a unique visual identity. 
        </p>
        <p> I am currently open for freelance work! Email me at amaliazamfir@gmail.com or <a href="contact.html">contact me here.</a></p>
